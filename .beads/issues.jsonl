Since the coverage check runs the full test:unit suite (which includes pre-commit.test.js), ESLint executes twice per pre-commit run.

The fix attempt (commit d4f1d3f) changed execSync to exec with Promise.all to run lint and coverage in parallel, but this does NOT reduce wall-clock time because both ESLint (~3s) and c8+mocha (~3.8s) are CPU-bound Node.js processes that contend for the same CPU cores when run concurrently. Measured results: 3 runs averaged 10.8 seconds (range 6.4s–15.2s), well above the 5-second requirement. The parallelization approach is fundamentally flawed for CPU-bound tasks on a single machine. To actually meet the \u003c5s target, the intern needs to either: (1) remove one of the expensive checks from the pre-commit hook (e.g., move coverage to CI), (2) use a faster linting approach (e.g., lint-staged to only lint changed files instead of the entire project), (3) cache ESLint results, or (4) restructure checks so coverage uses mocha directly instead of via npm (avoiding npm process spawn overhead).
