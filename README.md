## Requirements

- VS Code 1.106.1 or higher
- The `bd` command-line tool must be installed and available in your PATH
  - Install from: https://github.com/steveyegge/beads
  - If not installed, you'll see an error message with installation instructions

## Development

To work on this extension:

1. Open the folder in VS Code
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies (also installs git hooks)
3. Press `F5` to launch Extension Development Host
4. Make changes to `extension.js`
5. Reload the Extension Development Host window to test changes

### Pre-commit Hooks

This project uses **husky** to enforce code quality on every commit. Hooks are installed automatically when you run `npm install`.

The following validations run before each commit and **must all pass**:

| Check | Requirement |
|-------|-------------|
| **Lint** | Zero ESLint warnings or errors |
| **File length** | All source files ≤ 500 lines |
| **No skipped tests** | No `.skip()`, `.only()`, `xit()`, etc. |
| **Type annotations** | JSDoc on all exported functions |
| **Test coverage** | ≥ 80% line/branch/function coverage |

If any check fails, the commit is blocked with a clear error message.

```bash
# Run the pre-commit checks manually
npm run pre-commit

# Run tests with coverage report
npm run test:coverage
```

### Testing

This extension includes comprehensive test coverage with 100+ tests:

```bash
# Run all tests (lint + integration tests)
npm test

# Run lint only
npm run lint

# Run unit tests
npm run test:unit

# Run with coverage
npm run test:coverage
```

**Test Coverage:**
- ✅ Extension activation & deactivation
